## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to provide a __**quick**__ method for engineers to get started on setting up Azure Environments.

Creating interconnected Azure resources can be timeconsuming:
- Creation from the Azure Portal can involve a lot of clicks.
- Using the Azure CLI can involve a lot of workload in terms of making sure you are typing the correct parameters. 

The resources you deploy will not match prefectly what you are trying to create, but they be used as a **starting point***.
