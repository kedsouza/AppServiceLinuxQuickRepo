## Project Motivation Goal
The goal of the project is to provide a **quick** method for engineers to get started on setting up environments.
Creating interconnected Azure resources from the Azure Portal can involve a lot of clicks and using the Azure CLI can involve a lot of workload in terms of parameters. 

The resources you deploy will not match prefectly what you are trying to create, but can be used as a **starting point***.
