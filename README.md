# AppServiceQuickRepo

## Project Goal
### The goal of the project is to provide a __**quick**__ method for engineers to get started on setting up Azure Environments.

The resources you deploy will not match prefectly what you are trying to create, but they can be used as a **starting point**. 


## Open your Azure Shell, copy / paste the following code block in your shell to run. 
```
git clone https://github.com/kedsouza/AppServiceLinuxQuickRepo.git && cd AppServiceLinuxQuickRepo && python app.py
```

## Reasonings

Creating interconnected Azure resources can be time consuming:
- Creation from the Azure Portal can involve a lot of clicks.
- Using the Azure CLI can involve a lot of workload in terms of making sure you are typing the correct parameters.
